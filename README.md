# chatbot-controlPanel
this is a project I made for Smart Methods company, I created a chatbot for a page that controls the robotic arm and another page that controls the base of the robotic arm.
I used the IBM Watson Assistant website to create a chatbot.
The language of the chatbot is Arabic. This chatbot displays the website services and books appointments for using the robotic arm in the company also shows the communication channels with the website management.
