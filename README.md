# chatbot-controlPanel
this is a project I made for Smart Methods company, I created a chatbot for a page that controls the robotic arm and another page that controls the base of the robotic arm.
I used the IBM Watson Assistant website to create a chatbot.
The language of the chatbot is Arabic. This chatbot displays the website services and books appointments for using the robotic arm also shows the communication channels with the website management.
